Intention of this section is that attendees can learn and remember some of the very basic and most important aspects of writing clean code. To achieve this we have made a guide which contains most of the important topics and few lines explaining to each topic. Attendees will be first asked to read a section and then there will be discussion around it and then they will be actualally programming and will practice what they have learned. 

Guide is checked in at location software_craftsmanship/CleanCode/study_material/CleanCode.pptx

Follwing are the details of this secion  

Clean Code section will be divided into three parts

*** Meaningful Names   & Classes
        Slide/Booklet go through - 10 mins
        Discussion - 15 mins
        Coding exercise - 30 mins  (Robot problem that will also be used in TDD. This will be developed from scratch)
        Break 5 mins
*** Functions & Function Arguments  
        Slide/Booklet go through - 10 mins
        Discussion - 15 mins
        Coding exercise - 45 mins  (Continue on the Robot Problem and use what has been learned so far)
        Break 5 mins
*** Discussion on Data Structures vs Objects - 15 mins
    Code Smells
        Slide/Booklet go through - 10 mins
        Smell finding competition - 20 mins (Find maximum number of smells in the code that we have)
        Discussion - 20 mins (optional - depending on the time left)

Code for Code Smells is at path: software_craftsmanship/CleanCode/code_exercise
